    "\n",
    "Swain v. Alabama was a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 1965.  A black man, Swain, was accused of raping a white woman, and he had been convicted by an all-white jury.  The jury was selected from a panel that contained only 8 black people and 92 whites.  The panel was supposed to be a random sample from the eligible population of Talladega County, which was 26% black and 74% other ethnicities (and, by law, all male).\n",
    "\n",
    "Swain's lawyers argued that this reflected a bias in the jury panel selection process.  A five-justice majority of the Supreme Court disagreed, asserting that,\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The overall percentage disparity has been small and reflects no studied attempt to include or exclude a specified number of Negros.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Is 8 enough smaller than 26 to indicate bias?  This may seem like a judgement call.  Apparently five Supreme Court justices thought it was a matter of judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we can contradict the assertion with a computer simulation.  (However, the scarcity of computers at the time was no excuse.  Any statistician could have done this calculation by hand in 1965.)\n",

    "There is a long tradition of declaring that we can reject a null hypothesis with \"statistical significance\" if our p-value is less than 0.05, and with \"high statistical significance\" if it is less than 0.01.  These thresholds are historical accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's better to think of the p-value as measuring the strength of the evidence in favor of the null hypothesis.  Low values indicate that the evidence goes against the null hypothesis and in favor of some alternative model of the world.\n",

    "If you must use a threshold and come to a yes-or-no conclusion, come up with your own threshold by considering how much evidence you'd need to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "In this case, the null hypothesis seems somewhat implausible to begin with.  Why would changes in murder rates behave in such a simple way?  So we might be comfortable \"rejecting\" it if we found a p-value of, say, 0.02.  But, in fact, the data are quite consistent with the null hypothesis.\n",

    "1. The fact that there were 36 more increases than decreases in murder rates is not strong evidence against the hypothesis that murder rates were equally likely to go up or down.\n",
    "2. The changes in murder rates over this period were probably random.\n",
    "3. There is no discernable pattern in the changes in murder rates over this period.\n",
    "4. There were as many increases as decreases in the murder rate over this period.\n",
    "5. There were more increases than decreases in the murder rate over this period."
